TEMPLATE FOR RETROSPECTIVE (Team P03)
=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs done : 2/2
- Total points committed vs done : 7/7
- Nr of hours planned vs spent (as a team) : 28h40m / 35h55m


**Remember**  a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD 

### Detailed statistics

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#0_   |    10     |    -   |       8h     |      9h 20min        |
| _#1_      |      8   |    5    |      12h 30min      |   16h 55min           |
| _#2_      |   8      |     2   |     8h 10min       |        9h 50min      |
   

- Hours per task (average, standard deviation) : ( 1h 33m,  48min )
- Total task estimation error ratio: 0.798

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated : 2h
  - Total hours spent : 2h
  - Nr of automated unit test cases : 1
  - Coverage (if available) : 0
- E2E testing: 
  - Total hours estimated : not estimated
  - Total hours spent : 1h
- Code review :
  - Total hours estimated : not estimated
  - Total hours spent : 3h 30min
- Technical Debt management:
  - Total hours estimated 
  - Total hours spent 
  - Hours estimated for remediation by SonarQube 
  - Hours estimated for remediation by SonarQube only for the selected and planned issues 
  - Hours spent on remediation 
  - debt ratio (as reported by SonarQube under "Measures-Maintainability")
  - rating for each quality characteristic reported in SonarQube under "Measures" (namely reliability, security, maintainability )
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
  
  Not sufficiently detailed task description.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

  Spend more effort on the sprint planning especially on determining the correct number of tasks.
  Including Code review and task testing in the planned tasks.

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

   Team coordination : 
  - Keep up to date about the daily project progress.
  - Create a more equal assignement of tasks in terms of effort/time

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
  - Team building aperitif after tuesday class
  - Being able to deliver a working project
